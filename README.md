## üéµ Notes
- Don't leave the server/world if you haven't run the `/function [minigame]:stop` function.
- Try not to kill other people in situations where you're not supposed to. (disabling pvp hasn't been implemented)
- If there are any issues please try to replicate it before making an issue post.
